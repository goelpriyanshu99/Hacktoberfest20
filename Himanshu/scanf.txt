You have been using scanf just for inputting. But there's a lot more.

Limiting the digits of the input:
We can choose how many digits we want to input and discard the rest. 
scanf("%2d",&n) ,This will take max of two digits.


Inputting a date:
Inputting dates with different format is very easy in C!
Here's how:
scanf("%d%*c%d*%*c%d",&d,&m,&y)
This takes dates with format dd/mm/yy , dd-mm-yy or any other separator.
There are some other ways to do that as well.
scanf("%d/%d/%d",&d,&m,&y) 
For this, you need to specify the separator.

Reading until a specific character is encountered:
scanf("%[^a]",str);
This would read a string until 'a' is encountered.
You can give your own characters . It can be more than one as well.
scanf("%[^abcd]",str)
reads until any of the character in the square bracket is encountered.


Reading strings starting with digits only:
scanf("%[0-9]",str)
This would read strings  starting with digits until a non-digit character is encountered.
Likewise , We can do it for alphabets too. 
scanf("%[A-Za-z]",str)
